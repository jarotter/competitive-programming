# Competitive Programming
I'll post solutions mainly to problems from Codeforces and 
Red de Programaci√≥n Competitiva, our official competitions
for Mexico. 
Most of them will be in C++, but as I learn Python I'll post
them in it as well. 
Besides the specific problems, I'll keep a data structures and
algorithms folder with whatever I found useful.
